        The term job offer primarily refers to an offer made directly to an applicant to fill a vacancy, i.e.: to work for the company for a fixed monthly fee, a short term contract, or on a freelance basis. This usually happens after screening the documents (e.g. CV, cover letter ), conducting interviews, and the final decision for a certain candidate.
